// Data struct: has a node object that is functionally the same as the linked list, and also a count. 
// The top of the stack is the head of the linked list
// NOTHING FROM ll methods can be used. 

// Methods:

// Push: take an element (int) and add that to the top of the stack. Maybe have one that also takes in a node object. No ll methods can be used (because that would be cheating)

// Pop: remove the first element, and return the int value (maybe have one that returns a node too)

// Peek: return first value/node
